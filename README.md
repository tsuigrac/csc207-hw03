Assignment 3 by Grace Tsui and Justin Chen

This assignment consists of working with polymorphic compositions of text,
where text objects were combined, recombined, and reset. It also consists
of modeling grocery items and using interfaces to connect different object
types together. Finally, these objects were grouped together and this group
was changed with objects removed/added.
